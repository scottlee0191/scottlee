<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## Using template or build from scratch.

Nowadays, we have a lot website support write blog share knowledge for developer like medium.com, dev.to... But it hard to customize and
you are not admin so your posts can be deleted if they delete because it belongs to their system.
So how about building form scratch it may be hurt like we need buy a host, domain ex,... Luckily, we have a ton of
blog system come from GitHub. so I dedicated use `https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog` it's awesome
template free markdown, MDX, nextjs, tailwindcss,... come with ton of feature out of the box,...

## Setup environment

As I mention before we're using GitHub page to deploy static site, so we're using GitHub for git

#### First step clone source

You can clone it from github or using command

```
npx degit timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#typescript
```

run project in local

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```

#### Custom template

The template using nextjs and markdown for content so feel free to custom for yourself. when you are done with
color theme time to deploy it to GitHub page.

#### Create GitHub repo and push export to GitHub page branch

add script export to section script in package.json file to export static file

```
    "export": "next export",
```

push to GitHub page branch

```
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
```

#### GitHub Actions

In general, we need to push static file GitHub page branch when we have change in markdown or code. using GitHub action
help our job simple. We just need push the code and everything GitHub action do the rest.
Create GitHub action config file

```
touch .github/workflows/gh-pages.deploy.yml
```

Write the pipeline config

```
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        strategy:
            matrix:
                node-version: [16.x]
        steps:
            - name: Get files
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
              uses: actions/setup-node@v2
              with:
                  node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
            - name: create env file
              run: |
                touch .env
                echo NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/scottlee >> .env
                echo NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO=scottlee0191/scottlee >> .env
                echo NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPOSITORY_ID=R_kgDOG_ScyQ >> .env
                echo NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY=General >> .env
                echo NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID=DIC_kwDOG_Scyc4COK8f >> .env
            - name: Install packages
              run: npm ci
            - name: Build project
              run: npm run build
            - name: Export static files
              run: npm run export
            - name: Add .nojekyll file
              run: touch ./out/.nojekyll
            - name: Deploy
              uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.1
              with:
                  branch: gh-pages
                  folder: out
```

push code to GitHub and make a cup of coffee enjoin your website live

## Issue you may have

#### Can build because next/image can not build

You can fix it by add config for image page

```
  images: {
    loader: 'imgix',
    path: your_git_hub_page_url,
  },
```

put this config to next.config.js

#### Pipeline not working

This one happen because your config not correct try to fix pipeline or fix eslint
before run build locally without issue and then push
